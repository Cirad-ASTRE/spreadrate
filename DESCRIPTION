Description: Estimate the local velocity of propagation of an epidemic
    event, given dates and locations of observed cases. The method
    estimates the surface of first date of invasion by interpolation
    of the earliest observations in a neighbourhood and derives the
    local spread rate as the inverse slope of the surface. Quantify
    the estimation uncertainty by a Monte Carlo approach. Visualise 
    and simulate the spatio-temporal progress of epidemics.
